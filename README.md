# Find-A-Word
- need to have a specific type for the matrix representation

- we can have one class which will parse a user inputted text file
for the words themselves

- matrix class will hide the implementation of the matrix and is returned to the controller once built by the matrix controller. 
- matrix can just be a class storing the 2D array and a toString method so we can show the grid to the user. 
- then we have a class for matrix traversal which will traverse a matrix given
the matrix and list of words??

- we also need a player controller class which will just run in a loop until the game is over

- storing words in a hashset. (maybe hashmap with frequency because same word may appear more than once??)

- maybe create a Coordinate type to store coordinates
